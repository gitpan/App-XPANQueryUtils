=head1 NAME

list-xpan-dists - List distributions in {CPAN,MiniCPAN,DarkPAN} mirror

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.04 of list-xpan-dists (from Perl distribution App-XPANQueryUtils), released on 2014-11-09.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % list-xpan-dists

Examples:

 TODO

To see all options:

 % list-xpan-dists --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For simplicity and performance, this module parses distribution names from
tarball filenames mentioned in C<02packages.details.txt.gz>, so it is not perfect
(some release tarballs, especially older ones, are not properly named). For more
proper way, one needs to read the metadata file (C<*.meta>) for each
distribution.

 TODO

=head1 BASH COMPLETION

This script has bash completion capability.

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C list-xpan-dists list-xpan-dists

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. Just execute C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added in your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.
